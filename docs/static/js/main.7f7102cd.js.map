As we head there will be some breaking changes and this release includes some of these, so please read the section on Important Breaking Changes below to see what needs to be changed. Sorry!\\n\\n**Important breaking changes:**\\n\\n * `Event` -> `TimeEvent` (except static Event methods)\\n * Removed `atTime()` and `bisect()` from the Collection API, because these depend on an ordered list and should live on the TimeSeries.\\n * Removed the convenience static methods that wrapped `timeSeriesListReduce()`, specifically `timeSeriesListSum()` and `timeSeriesListAvg()`, use `timeSeriesListReduce()` now with whatever reducer function you want (e.g. `sum()`)\\n * `Event.sum()` and `Event.avg()` are removed. Use `Event.combine()` instead.\\n\\n**Features and changes:**\\n\\n * **TimeSeries merging**: Improves performance for merging and combining TimeSeries events up to 10 times (Fixes [#51](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/51)).\\n * **TimeSeries merging API** TimeSeries level API has been simplified, allowing any reducer function (e.g. `avg()` to be used when combining multiple TimeSeries, but removing some wrapper functions (see breaking changes below). (Fixes [#58](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/58), [#59](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/59))\\n * **Event class hierarchy**: The event class structure was finally cleaned up internally, but this comes with a major breaking change: events that were of class `Event` before (i.e. had a timestamp) are now `TimeEvents`, while `Event` is a base class shared by `TimeEvent`, `TimeRangeEvent` and `IndexedEvent`. Further, `Events` can now be further sub-classed (see Avro change for why). Static event methods are still on `Event`.\\n * **Avro support**. Along with the ability to subclass an `Event` comes the ability to define a schema for the subclass. This allows `Event`s, `TimeSeries` and `TimeRange`s to serialize themselves to Avro buffers for compact and correct transfers. This feature is still experimental, and isn't currently supported in PyPond.\\n * **De-duplication** - you can now de-duplicate the events in a `Collection` with `Collection.dedup()`. Later events win. In a related change you can use `collection.atKey()` to get back a list of events at that exact time, timerange or index, or a map of key to a list of events at that key with `eventListAsMap()`. This partially addresses [#52](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/52).\\n * **Prettier** - Uses prettier for code formatting now, so lots of stylistic changes in this release. Hopefully this will simplify that part of code maintenance going forward.\\n\\n\\n## v0.7.1\\n> October 2016\\n\\nPatch release to fix several bugs and improve performance:\\n- renaming columns now does so with mapKeys, rather than breaking the whole thing apart\\n- fixes merging of TimeSeries so that if the result isn't chronological then it will sort them before trying to make a new TimeSeries\\n- fixes atTime() boundary condition (#45)\\n- fixed align processors to handle initial events that are already aligned\\n- internal calls to setCollection can skip the isChronological test with a flag since they know they are maintaining order.\\n\\n## v0.7\\n> September 2016\\n\\nThis update had three main goals:\\n - Better handling of imperfect data.\\n - Add quantile and percentile calculations\\n - Improve API consistency\\n\\nIn addition, PyPond is now available with feature parity to the pond.js.\\n\\nBreaking changes to look out for: `Pipeline.aggregate()` has changed to allow better composition of emitted events, aggregation functions are now supplied as `avg()` rather than simple `avg`. And `UnboundedIns` are now simply `Stream`.\\n\\n**General:**\\n\\n -  Consistent use of fieldSpec, fieldPath etc across the API.\\n -  Aggregation functions now all need to be specified as `avg()` rather than `avg`. i.e. they are now a function that returns a function. This is to allow them to take parameters. e.g `percentile(95)`.\\n -  * All aggregation functions now accept a strategy for dealing with missing values. Missing values in pond.js are `NaN`s, `null`, or `undefined`. Strategies added are:\\n    - `keepMissing` - pass through all values to the aggregator\\n    - `ignoreMissing` - pass though only non-missing values\\n    - `zeroMissing` - turn missing values into 0\\n    - `propagateMissing` - cause the aggregator to return null if there is a missing value\\n\\n**Collection:**\\n\\n - Adds `quantile()` and `percentile()` aggregation functions\\n\\n**TimeSeries:**\\n\\n - Adds quantile and percentile aggregation functions\\n - Fixed: better handling of UTC times when generating IndexedEvent results\\n - More mutation support:\\n    - Added `renameColumns()` to deep rename Events within a TimeSeries\\n    - Added `setName()` to change the name of a TimeSeries\\n    - Added `setMeta(key, value)` to change the meta data in a TimeSeries\\n  In each case you will get a new TimeSeries back.\\n - Added `fill()` method to fill in missing values within a TimeSeries, using 0s, padding (last good value) or linear interpolation. In each case you can also specify a limit to the fill\\n - Added `align()` method to interpolate data to specific time boundaries (e.g. every 5 minutes). The interpolation can be with last value or linear interpolation. Like fill, a limit can also be supplied.\\n - Added `rate()` method to return the derivative of the TimeSeries. Optionally you can ignore negative values.\\n\\n**Pipelines:**\\n\\n - Support for`fill()`, `align()` and `rate()` within a Pipeline.\\n - `UnboundedIn` is now `Stream`.\\n - Changes `aggregation` to more explicitly define the output fields. This allows you to perform multiple aggregations on the same input field, such as aggregating temperature over a collection window to average_temp and max_temp.\\n\\nBefore:\\n```\\nconst p = Pipeline()\\n  ...\\n  .aggregate({in: avg, out: avg})\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nAfter:\\n```\\nconst p = Pipeline()\\n  ...\\n  .aggregate({\\n      in: {in: keep()},\\n      in_avg: {in: avg()},\\n      in_95th: {in: percentile(95)}}\\n  })\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n - As shown in the above example, you can use the `percentile()` function. Note that this is a little different from the others in that you need to call the function with the percentile value you want. A second parameter controls the way the function behaves when a percentile does not land on a specific sample. The default is to linearly interpolate.\\n - Fixes a bug where Pipeline.taker() would ignore the first event.\\n\\n**Internal**\\n\\n - Website now built with create-react-app\\n - Tests use Jest now and run in the terminal (for create-react-app workflow)\\n - General project restructuring\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.6\\n\\nThis update concentrates on providing a better API for processing a TimeSeries object. It updates the Pipeline code to be able to return the results as an alternative to evoking a callback function. Using this API several methods on the TimeSeries have been reworked to directly return their results as a new TimeSeries. In addition, TimeSeries now has several new methods to do roll-ups aggregations and collections directly.\\n\\n**TimeSeries**\\n\\nConstruction:\\n - a TimeSeries is now checked for chronological events and the code will throw if there is. This is because there are several methods on the TimeSeries that will produce incorrect results if this is the case and it is far from intuitive why.\\n\\nWith the change to the batch API we can now greatly simplify several methods on TimeSeries. These three methods now directly return a new TimeSeries:\\n - `map()`\\n - `select()`\\n - `collapse()`.\\n\\nNew methods that use Pipelines internally to perform common roll-up processing of TimeSeries:\\n - `fixedWindowRollup()`\\n - `hourlyRollup()`\\n - `dailyRollup()`\\n - `monthlyRollup()`\\n - `yearlyRollup()`\\n - `collectByFixedWindow()` - to build a map of new Collections given a fixed window (like \\\"5m\\\"). The result is a map from the window name (e.g. \\\"5m-12345\\\") to a Collection. This is essentially tiling the TimeSeries.\\n\\nAdditional new methods:\\n - `crop()` - you could always use slice() but this is simpler. Just give it a TimeRange and you get back a new TimeSeries.\\n - `atTime()`, `atFirst()`, `atLast()` and  `* events()` generator - Convenience methods so you don't have to go through the TimeSeries' Collection.\\n\\n**Pipelines:**\\n\\nImplements #22 - when processing a synchronous source we can just accumulate the result (either EventList or CollectionMap) on the Pipeline and return that result directly. This enables methods to be built on TimeSeries, for example, that can simply return a new TimeSeries and not dump the user into a callback or force them to guess if they can assume the function will be called synchronously. See #22 for a more detailed discussion about this. Note: This is pretty experimental and there's no facility to cope with an async source at the moment. In that case there just won't be a return value and no warning or error will be given. We don't currently use such a source, but others might. Regardless, this API extension is not appropriate in that case.\\n\\nAdds two new methods to a Pipeline() to expose this to the Pipeline user:\\n - `toCollectionMap()` - maps a mapping of the key of the collection to the Collection itself. The key comes from a combination of the groupBy() and windowBy() directives on the Pipeline. The key is determined like this:\\n    - If there isn't a window or group key, the collection will output to \\\"all\\\" -> collection.\\n    - If one type of grouping, that grouping will be used. window name or group by.\\n    - If both, they will be concatenated together with a \\\"--\\\".\\n - `toEventList()` - puts every event output into a list.\\n\\nWindowing changes:\\n - `clearWindow()` - remove the window, i.e. reset to a global window\\n - `clearGroupBy()` - remove the groupby setting\\n - \\\"daily\\\", \\\"monthly\\\" and \\\"yearly\\\" window types are now supported\\n - If building with a non-fixed or non-global window, we build IndexedEvents with local time. We could possibly allow the user to determine this but this is probably the best default behavior. (note, there's no tests for this. This is rather hard to test with JS)\\n\\nOther bug fixes:\\n - Fixes a bug where a Converter would not work correctly in batch mode because it wasn't being cloned correctly.\\n\\n**Collection:**\\n\\nConstruction:\\n - Require the type to be passed in when constructing with an Immutable.List (Fixes #16). This is generally only used internally.\\n\\nNew methods:\\n - `isChronological()` - return if a Collection's events are chronological.\\n - `sortByTime()` - Reorder Collection events to be chronological.\\n\\n**Index:**\\n\\nStatic functions to build an Index strings for daily, monthly and yearly rollups:\\n - `getDailyIndexString()`\\n - `getMonthlyIndexString()`\\n - `getYearlyIndexString()`\\n\\n**IndexedEvents:**\\n - Fixes a bug where the UTC flag was not being correctly set on IndexedEvents.\\n\\n**Collector:**\\n - Ability to collect based on daily, monthly or yearly buckets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.5\\n\\nLarge update causing many API changes, especially within what was previously the Processor pipeline (now Pipeline). The core structures such as Events and TimeSeries remain largely the same, at least from an API perspective, with mostly feature additions and bug fixes. We are still evolving the pipeline code but feel this is a significant step forward and one which we can build on going forward.\\n\\n### v0.5.0\\n\\n * Pipeline is a complete rewrite of the Processing code. It now unifies operations on sets of Events into a Collection class that also backs the TimeSeries itself. This enables the pipelines to operate on either streams of Events or on TimeSeries or Collections.\\n * Pipelines therefore support a limited notion of either streaming or batch processing.\\n * Pipelines support fixed window aggregations as well as general grouping by key or function\\n * Pipeline operators:\\n   - select() for choosing specific event fields\\n   - collapse() for collapsing specific event fields using a reducer\\n   - map() for doing element-wise transformations of events\\n   - filter() for conditionally removing events based on a filter function\\n   - take() for accepting only the first n events through the pipeline, for a given window and key\\n   - count() for counting up events that fall within a given window and key\\n   - aggregate() for building new aggregated events from collections based on the given window and key\\n   - converters for converting between event types\\n  * Pipeline simple triggers for each event, each collection discard and on flush using emitOn()\\n  * Pipeline output support using to() for emitting Collections and Events\\n  * Pipeline input support using from() for Collections, TimeSeries, or UnboundedIns.\\n * Event access using get() allows use of fieldSpecs, which can be fieldNames or dot delimited paths to deeper data\\n * Events no longer have a key. Groupby keys ares managed by the pipeline itself now\\n * TimeRange: fixes lastYear() static function\\n * TimeSeries: fixes duplicate size() definition\\n * TimeSeries and Collection: first() and last() are aggregation functions now, while atFirst() and atLast() returns the first/last event in the series/collection\\n * Project\\n    - Updated to Babel 6\\n    - Added code coverage\\n    - Auto-build of docs for website\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.4\\n\\n### v0.4.2\\n\\n * Fixed creation of a `TimeSeries` from `TimeRangeEvents`.\\n * Fixed `timerange()` calculation of a `TimeSeries` made of `TimeRangeEvents`.\\n\\n### v0.4.1\\n\\n * Fixed TimeSeries import\\n\\n### v0.4.0\\n\\n * Support for processing chains. e.g.\\n \\n```\\n    const processor = Processor()\\n        .groupBy(\\\"channelName\\\")\\n        .aggregate(\\\"5m\\\", avg)\\n        .collect(\\\"1d\\\", false, timeseries => {\\n            // --> Output timeseries representing 1 day of 5 min averages\\n        });\\n```\\n\\n * `Aggregators` and `collector` now support emitting events \\\"always\\\", and not just when the \\\"next\\\" bucket is created\\n * Processing function API has been cleaned up. To flush events, use `flush()` (`done()` and `sync()` are gone)\\n * Event internals are now an Immutable.map rather than using member variables that could be modified\\n * Events support keys to enable the ability to do groupBy operations. You can add a key to an `Event` with `setKey()`, and you'll get a new `Event` back which is the same as the old one, but with a key. You can query the key with, unsurprisingly, `key()`.\\n * `Groupers` are a new `Event` processor which takes an incoming event stream and emits the same event but with a key on it. This enables downstream processing, such as aggregation, to group based on the key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.3\\n\\n### v0.3.0\\n\\n * Better support for nested objects:\\n    * Converts deeper structures to Immutable objects internally\\n    * Added \\\"value functions\\\" to operations that deal with columns of values so that you can pull out internals of nested structures.\\n    * Event's get() function will convert deep Immutable structures to JS objects.\\n * You can now use either value() or get() to get a value out of an Event.\\n * Added ability to convert to time based Events when inserting IndexedEvents into a collection. This can be much faster to query.\\n * Began work on ability to do things like sum a series or isolate columns of a series.\\n * Website update as well as uniform linting\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.2\\n\\n### v0.2.1\\n\\n * Fixed an issue with merge.\\n\\n### v0.2.0\\n\\n * You can either merge two series with different columns together, or same columns and different times.\\n\\n```\\nconst trafficSeries = TimeSeries.merge(\\\"traffic\\\", [inTraffic, outTraffic]);\\n```\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 166 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"<a name=\\\"Collection\\\"></a>\\n\\n## Collection\\nA collection is an abstraction for a bag of Events.\\n\\nYou typically construct a Collection from a list of Events, which\\nmay be either within an Immutable.List or an Array.

There are two basic types:\\n*Multiplier index* - the number of some unit of time (hours, days etc) since the UNIX epoch.\\n*Calendar index* - The second represents a calendar range, such as Oct 2014.\\n\\nFor the first type, a multiplier index, an example might be:\\n\\n```text\\n    1d-12355      //  30th Oct 2003 (GMT), the 12355th day since the UNIX epoch\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use seconds (e.g. 30s), minutes (e.g. 5m), hours (e.g. 1h) or days (e.g. 7d).\\n\\nHere are several examples of a calendar index:\\n\\n```text\\n    2003-10-30    // 30th Oct 2003\\n    2014-09       // Sept 2014\\n    2015          // All of the year 2015\\n```\\n\\nAn Index is a nice representation of certain types of time intervals because it can be cached with its string representation as a key. A specific chunk of time, and associated data can be looked up based on that string. It also allows us to represent things like months, which have variable length.\\n\\nAn Index is also useful when collecting into specific time ranges, for example generating all the 5 min (\\\"5m\\\") maximum rollups within a specific day (\\\"1d\\\").

Each row is at a different time (or timerange), and each value corresponds to the column labels.\\n\\nAs just hinted at, the first column may actually be:\\n\\n - \\\"time\\\"\\n - \\\"timeRange\\\" represented by a `TimeRange`\\n - \\\"index\\\" - a time range represented by an `Index`. By using an index it is possible, for example, to refer to a specific month:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst availabilityData = {\\n    name: \\\"Last 3 months availability\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"index\\\", \\\"uptime\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [\\\"2015-06\\\", \\\"100%\\\"], // <-- 2015-06 specified here represents June 2015\\n        [\\\"2015-05\\\", \\\"92%\\\"],\\n        [\\\"2015-04\\\", \\\"87%\\\"],\\n    ]\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can construct a `TimeSeries` with a list of events.\\nThese may be `TimeEvents`, `TimeRangeEvents` or `IndexedEvents`. Here's an example of that:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst events = [];\\nevents.push(new TimeEvent(new Date(2015, 7, 1), {value: 27}));\\nevents.push(new TimeEvent(new Date(2015, 8, 1), {value: 29}));\\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\\n    name: \\\"avg temps\\\",\\n    events: events\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Nested data\\n\\nThe values do not have to be simple types like the above examples. Here's an\\nexample where each value is itself an object with \\\"in\\\" and \\\"out\\\" keys:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\\n    name: \\\"Map Traffic\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"NASA_north\\\", \\\"NASA_south\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [1400425951000, {in: 100, out: 200}, {in: 145, out: 135}],\\n        [1400425952000, {in: 200, out: 400}, {in: 146, out: 142}],\\n        [1400425953000, {in: 300, out: 600}, {in: 147, out: 158}],\\n        [1400425954000, {in: 400, out: 800}, {in: 155, out: 175}],\\n    ]\\n});\\n```\\n\\nComplex data is stored in an Immutable structure. To get a value out of nested\\ndata like this you will get the event you want (by row), as usual, and then use\\n`get()` to fetch the value by column name. The result of this call will be a\\nJSON copy of the Immutable data so you can query deeper in the usual way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nseries.at(0).get(\\\"NASA_north\\\")[\\\"in\\\"]  // 200`\\n```\\n\\nIt is then possible to use a value mapper function when calculating different\\nproperties. For example, to get the average \\\"in\\\" value of the NASA_north column:\\n\\n```javascript\\nseries.avg(\\\"NASA_north\\\", d => d.in);  // 250\\n```\\n\\n**Kind**: global class  \\n\\n*

These counters generally increases monotonically. In this example we combine the alignment with the rate function to get a TimeSeries of network traffic (e.g. bits per second).\\n\\nWhile this example relates to network traffic, it could also apply to click streams, etc.\\n\\nData we get from the network is requested every 30 seconds from the routers. This is done with SNMP, a network management protocol. The response from the network arrives some time shortly after the request. At this point we timestamp the value because it is the most representative time we can come up with (the router does not timestamp the response). As a result, we typically find our incoming data events to be approximately every 30 seconds, but not quite. We might have values at 1:31, 2:02, 2:31, 3:04, etc.\\n\\nIn addition to this, we experience missing points from time to time (in the order of a handful per day) and we also experience counter reset where the counter reaches a numerical limit and resets itself.\\n\\nThe problem with this is that it makes downstream processing much harder to deal with.\\n\\nPond has several useful features to address this data ingestion problem. In pond.js, data can be processed as a stream (though a naive one that doesn't have mechanisms for dealing with out of order data), or as a batch process on a bounded source such as a TimeSeries. In either case we might want to use Pond to manage our situation.\\n\\n## Preparing the data\\n\\nLet's say we want to write a batch task to do this, where we read approximately a days data from some storage to process.\\n\\nOur initial goal is to collect our data into a `TimeSeries` object. From there we can process it either with the built in methods or by feeding it through a pipeline.\\n\\nTo collect data into a TimeSeries object we would generally map it from our native format into an object such as the following:\\n\\n```js\\n    const trafficData = {\\n        name: \\\"ames-lab-traffic\\\",\\n        columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"in\\\"],\\n        points: [\\n            [[1468886425000, 30149747500170],\\n            [1468886456000, 30149754529057],\\n            [1468886487000, 30149765964686],\\n            [1468886517000, 30149774808349],\\n            [1468886548000, 30149786620883],\\n            [1468886578000, 30149797218334],\\n            [1468886609000, 30149806694886],\\n            [1468886639000, 30149814247765],\\n            [1468886640000, null],\\n            [1468886670000, 30149836244496],\\n            [1468886700000, 30149845139313],\\n            [1468886731000, 30149853210590],\\n            [1468886761000, 30149861469019]\\n            ...],\\n        ]\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nAnd then construct a TimeSeries from that:\\n\\n```js\\n    const traffic = new TimeSeries(trafficData);\\n```\\n\\n## Alignment\\n\\nNext we want to get our data onto exact 30 second boundaries. This is now a simple task of calling the align() function on the TimeSeries.\\n\\n```js\\n    const aligned = traffic.align({\\n        fieldSpec: \\\"in\\\",\\n        period: \\\"30s\\\",\\n        method: \\\"linear\\\",\\n        limit: 2\\n    });\\n```\\n\\nSome things to note here: firstly, we refer to the \\\"in\\\" column with the fieldSpec. If we had both the \\\"in\\\" and \\\"out\\\" values in our TimeSeries we could have used a fieldSpec of [\\\"in\\\", \\\"out\\\"]. Secondly, we specify the alignment boundaries with the period, in this case we want to align the data to our 30 second request rate. Thirdly, we use \\\"linear\\\" interpolation to determine the value of the counter (\\\"in\\\" value) at the boundaries. And finally, we set a limit to 2. This will cause minor gaps in the data to be filled, while larger outages are left null.\\n\\n## Rate (derivative)\\n\\nFinally, we want to calculate the traffic rate from the growing counter value.\\n\\nTimeSeries has a method for this too: rate(). It generates a new `TimeSeries` of `TimeRangeEvent` objects which contain the derivative between columns in two consecutive `Event` objects. The start and end time of the time range events correspond to the timestamps of the two events the calculation was derived from.\\n\\nThe primary use case for this was to generate rate data from monotonically increasing SNMP counter values like this:\\n\\n```js\\n    const baseRate = aligned.rate({fieldSpec: \\\"in\\\", allowNegative: false});\\n```\\n\\nNow we have the `baseRate` as a TimeSeries. We've taken our raw counter data, done a linearly interpolated alignment to 30 second boundaries, and then calculate the rates by calculating the derivative between the aligned boundaries.\\n\\nNote that we also passed in `allowNegative` to be false. This will replace a negative change in the counter value to output a null instead of a rate. You could then use `fill()` to fill in that point, or leave it as a missing value.\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 175 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"## Glossary\\n---\\n\\nThis guide contains a description of terms that are specific to Pond. Please let us know if there are terms in the API or documentation that need further explanation and we will update this document.\\n\\n---\\n### Alignment\\n\\nThis refers to taking a sequence of data that may be irregular in timestamps and converting that to fall on specific time boundaries. For instance you could have data at 1:31, 2:01, 2:34, and 3:01 and would like to align this to exact 30s boundaries (1:30, 2:00, 2:30, and 3:00). Pond can do this with `TimeSeries.align()` or in a Pipeline, with a variety of options for how the incoming data is interpolated to the aligned output.\\n\\n---\\n### Collapsing\\n\\nThis is the process of taking multiple columns of data and turning it into a single column.\\n\\n---\\n### Fields: fieldSpec and fieldPath\\n\\nThere are some points to note about the nomenclature that the `pypond` and `pond` code bases use to refer to the \\\"columns of data\\\" in the time series event objects. This `TimeSeries`:\\n\\n```\\nconst DATA = {\\n    name: \\\"traffic\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"value\\\", \\\"status\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [1400425947000, 52, \\\"ok\\\"],\\n        [1400425948000, 18, \\\"ok\\\"],\\n        [1400425949000, 26, \\\"fail\\\"],\\n        [1400425950000, 93, \\\"offline\\\"]\\n    ]\\n};\\n```\\n\\ncontains two **columns**: `value` and `status`.\\n\\nHowever this `TimeSeries`:\\n\\n```\\nconst DATA_FLOW = {\\n    name: \\\"traffic\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"direction\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [1400425947000, {'in': 1, 'out': 2}],\\n        [1400425948000, {'in': 3, 'out': 4}],\\n        [1400425949000, {'in': 5, 'out': 6}],\\n        [1400425950000, {'in': 7, 'out': 8}]\\n    ]\\n};\\n```\\n\\ncontains only one column `direction`, but that column has two more columns - `in` and `out` - nested under it. In the following examples, these nested columns will be referred to as **deep paths**.\\n\\nWhen specifying columns to the methods that set, retrieve and manipulate data, we use two argument types: `fieldSpec` and `fieldPath`. They are similar yet different enough to warrant this document.\\n\\n#### fieldPath\\n\\nA `fieldPath` refers to a **single** column in a series. Any method that takes a `fieldPath` as an argument only acts on one column at a time. The value passed to this argument can be either a string, an array or `null`.\\n\\n##### String variant\\n\\nWhen a string is passed, it can be one of the following formats:\\n\\n * simple path - the name of a single \\\"top level\\\" column. In the `DATA` example above, this would be either `value` or `status`.\\n * deep path - the path pointing to a single nested columns with each \\\"segment\\\" of the path delimited with a period. In the `DATA_FLOW` example above, the incoming data could be retrieved with `direction.in` as the `fieldPath`.\\n\\n##### List variant\\n\\nWhen a array is passed as a `fieldPath`, each element in the array is **a single segment of the path to a column**. So to compare with the string examples:\\n\\n * `['value']` would be equivalent to the string `value`.\\n * `['direction', 'in']` would be equivalent to the string `direction.in`.\\n\\nThis is particularly important to note because **this behavior is different** than passing a list to a `fieldSpec` arg.\\n\\n##### `None`\\n\\nIf no `fieldPath` is specified (defaulting to `null`), then the default column `value` will be used.\\n\\n#### fieldSpec\\n\\nA `fieldSpec` refers to **one or more** columns in a series. When a method takes a `fieldSpec`, it may act on multiple columns in a `TimeSeries`. The value passed to this argument can be either a string, an array or `null`.\\n\\n##### String variant\\n\\nThe string variant is essentially identical to the `fieldPath` string variant - it is a path to a single column of one of the following formats:\\n\\n * simple path - the name of a single \\\"top level\\\" column. In the `DATA` example above, this would be either `value` or `status`.\\n * deep path - the path pointing to a single nested columns with each \\\"segment\\\" of the path delimited with a period. In the `DATA_FLOW` example above, the incoming data could be retrieved with `direction.in` as the `fieldSpec`.\\n\\n##### List variant\\n\\nPassing a array to `fieldSpec` is different than the aforementioned behavior in that it is explicitly referring to **one or more columns**. Rather than each element being segments of a path, **each element is a full path to a single column**.\\n\\nUsing the previous examples:\\n\\n * `['in', 'out']` would act on both the `in` and `out` columns from the `DATA` example.\\n * `['direction.in', 'direction.out']` - here each element is a fully formed \\\"deep path\\\" to the two data columns in the `DATA_FLOW` example.\\n\\nThe lists do not have to have more than one element: `['value'] == 'value'`.\\n\\nNOTE: accidentally passing this style of list to an arg that is actually a `fieldPath` will most likely result in an error. Passing something like `['in', 'out']` as a `fieldPath` will attempt to retrieve the nested column `in.out` which probably doesn't exist.\\n\\n##### `None`\\n\\nIf no `fieldSpec` is specified (defaulting to `null`), then the default column `value` will be used.\\n\\n#### fieldSpecList\\n\\nThis is a less common variant of the `fieldSpec`. It is used in the case where the method is going to **specifically act on multiple columns**, such as `TimeSeries.collapse()`, where an array is expected. Therefore its usage is identical to the array variant of `fieldSpec`.\\n\\n---\\n### Index\\n\\nPond refers to certain standard time ranges, such as a particular hour, using an index. An index consists of two parts: a period such as \\\"this refers to a 6 hour period\\\", described with a string as \\\"6h\\\", and a position, which is a number that describes which 6 hour period in history we are referring to. An index such as \\\"6h-1234\\\" would be the 1234th 6hr period from the UNIX epoch (Jan 1st, 1970, UTC time). This string is typically referred to as an \\\"Index String\\\". This is distinct from an Index, which is an object wrapping of this string to allow easier handling of the index.\\n\\n---\\n### Missing values\\n\\nIn pond, a missing value is a `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`. That is distinct from a point on a TimeSeries that doesn't exist at all. You can use `fill()` to fill in missing values, while you might use `align()` to add new points where points where expected but non-existent.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are aggregating over a `Collection` or `TimeSeries`, you can supply filter functions that will treat missing values in a variety of ways.\\n\\n---\\n### Pipeline\\n\\nThis is Pond's main processing mechanism. It is an event based system that can process either streaming events, or batch process bounded collections of events such as a TimeSeries.\\n\\n---\\n### Processor\\n\\nA node generated internally in a Pipeline. These nodes take events in and produce events out. You don't work with Processors directly. Instead you use the chainable methods on the Pipeline.\\n\\n---\\n### Roll-ups\\n\\nWe use the term roll-up when building summary TimeSeries. An example would be turning 30 second measurement data into a TimeSeries of 5 minute average summaries.\\n\\nYou can perform common roll-ups directly on a TimeSeries, or as part of a Pipeline.\\n\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 176 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"\\n# Pond.js\\n\\n---\\n\\nPond.js is a library built on top of [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to provide time-based data structures, serialization and processing within our tools.\\n\\nFor data structures it unifies the use of time ranges, events and collections and time series. For processing it provides a chained pipeline interface to aggregate, collect and process batches or streams of events.\\n\\nWe are still developing Pond.js as it integrates further into our code, so it may change or be incomplete in parts. That said, it has a growing collection of tests and we will strive not to break those without careful consideration.\\n\\n## Rational\\n\\n[ESnet](http://www.es.net) runs a large research network for the US Department of Energy. Our tools consume events and time series data throughout our network visualization applications and data processing chains. As our tool set grew, so did our need to build a Javascript library to work with this type of data that was consistent and dependable. The alternative for us has been to pass ad-hoc data structures between the server and the client, making all elements of the system much more complicated. Not only do we need to deal with different formats at all layers of the system, we also repeat our processing code over and over. Pond.js was built to address these pain points.\\n\\nThe result might be as simple as comparing two time ranges:\\n\\n```js\\nconst timerange = timerange1.intersection(timerange2);\\ntimerange.asRelativeString();  // \\\"a few seconds ago to a month ago\\\"\\n```\\n\\nOr simply getting the average value in a timeseries:\\n\\n```js\\ntimeseries.avg(\\\"sensor\\\");\\n```\\n\\nOr quickly performing aggregations on a timeseries:\\n\\n```js\\nconst timeseries = new TimeSeries(weatherData);\\nconst dailyAvg = timeseries.fixedWindowRollup(\\\"1d\\\", {value: avg});\\n```\\n\\nOr much higher level batch or stream processing using the Pipeline API:\\n\\n```js\\nconst p = Pipeline()\\n    .from(timeseries)\\n    .take(10)\\n    .groupBy(e => e.value() > 65 ? \\\"high\\\" : \\\"low\\\")\\n    .emitOn(\\\"flush\\\")\\n    .to(CollectionOut, (collection, windowKey, groupByKey) => {\\n        result[groupByKey] = collection;\\n    }, true);\\n```\\n\\n## What does it do?\\n\\nPond has three main goals:\\n\\n 1. **Data Structures** - Provide a robust set of time-related data structures, built on Immutable.js\\n 2. **Serialization** - Provide serialization of these structures for transmission across the wire as Avro buffers or strings, including to our Python version of this library\\n 3. **Processing** - Provide processing operations to work with those structures\\n\\nHere is a summary of what is provided:\\n\\n* **TimeRange** - a begin and end time, packaged together\\n* **Index** - A time range denoted by a string, for example \\\"5m-1234\\\" is a specific 5 minute time range, or \\\"2014-09\\\" is September 2014\\n* **TimeEvent** - A timestamp and a data object packaged together\\n* **IndexedEvents** - An Index and a data object packaged together. e.g. 1hr max value\\n* **TimeRangeEvents** - A TimeRange and a data object packaged together. e.g. outage event occurred from 9:10am until 10:15am\\n\\nAnd forming together collections of events:\\n\\n* **Collection** - A bag of events, with a helpful set of methods for operating on those events\\n* **TimeSeries** - An ordered Collection of Events and associated meta data, along with operations to roll-up, aggregate, break apart and recombine TimeSeries.\\n\\nAnd then high level processing via pipelines:\\n\\n* **Pipeline** - Stream or batch style processing of events to build more complex processing operations, either on fixed TimeSeries or incoming realtime data.

Pond.js contains several methods to adjust or sanitize a series of less than optimal data. As with all other mutation operations in pond.js, these methods will return new `Event` objects, new `Collections` and new `TimeSeries` as apropos.\\n\\n### Filling\\n\\nData might contain missing or otherwise invalid values. `TimeSeries.fill()` can perform a variety of fill operations to smooth or make sure that the data can be processed in math operations without blowing up.\\n\\nIn pond.js, a value is considered \\\"invalid\\\" if it `undefined`, `null` or `NaN`. In PyPond `None`, a `NaN` value, or an empty string are considered missing.\\n\\n#### Usage\\n\\nThe `fill()` method on a TimeSeries takes a single `options` argument. Options are:\\n* `fieldSpec` - is the same as it is in the rest of the code - a string or list of strings denoting \\\"columns\\\" in the data. It can point `to.deep.values` using the usual dot notation.\\n* `method` - denotes the fill or interpolation method to use. Valid values are **zero**, **pad** and **linear**.\\n* `limit` - a limit on the number of events that will be filled and returned in the new `TimeSeries`. The default is to fill all the events with no limit.\\n\\nA complete sample usage could look like this:\\n\\n```\\n    const ts = new TimeSeries(data);\\n\\n    const filled = ts.fill({\\n        fieldSpec: ['direction.in', 'direction.out'],\\n        method: \\\"linear\\\",\\n        limit=6\\n    });\\n```\\n\\n##### The method option\\n\\nThere are three fill methods:\\n\\n* `zero` - the default - will transform any invalid value to a zero.\\n* `pad` - replaces an invalid value with the the previous good value: `[1, null, null, 3]` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 3]`.\\n* `linear` - interpolate the gaps based on the surrounding good values: `[1, null, null, null, 3]` becomes `[1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]`.\\n\\nNote: neither `pad` or `linear` can fill the first value in a series if it is invalid, and they can't start filling until good value has been seen: `[null, null, null, 1, 2, 3]` would remain unchanged. Similarly, `linear` can not fill the last value in a series.\\n\\n##### The `limit` option\\n\\nThe optional `limit` controls how many values will be filled before it gives up and starts returning the invalid data until a valid value is seen again.\\n\\nThere might be a situation where it makes sense to fill in a couple of missing values, but no sense to pad out long spans of missing data. This options sets the limit of the number of missing values that will be filled - or in the case of `linear` *attempt* to be filled - before it just starts returning invalid data until the next valid value is seen.\\n\\nSo given `limit: 2` the following values will be filled in the following ways:\\n\\n```\\nOriginal:\\n    [1, null, null, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nZero:\\n    [1, 0, 0, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nPad:\\n    [1, 1, 1, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nLinear:\\n    [1, null, null, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n```\\n\\nUsing methods `zero` and `pad` the first two missing values are filled and the third is skipped. When using the `linear` method, nothing gets filled because a valid value has not been seen before the limit has been reached, so it just gives up and returns the missing data.\\n\\nWhen filling multiple columns, the count is maintained on a per-column basis.  So given the following data:\\n\\n```\\n    const data = {\\n        name: \\\"traffic\\\",\\n        columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"direction\\\"],\\n        points: [\\n            [1400425947000, {\\\"in\\\": 1, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425948000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425949000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425950000, {\\\"in\\\": 3, \\\"out\\\": 8}],\\n            [1400425960000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425970000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": 12}],\\n            [1400425980000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": 13}],\\n            [1400425990000, {\\\"in\\\": 7, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400426000000, {\\\"in\\\": 8, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400426010000, {\\\"in\\\": 9, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400426020000, {\\\"in\\\": 10, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n        ]\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThe `in` and `out` sub-columns will be counted and filled independently of each other.\\n\\nIf `limit` is not set, no limits will be placed on the fill and all values will be filled as apropos to the selected method.\\n\\n##### Constructing `linear` fill `Pipeline` chains\\n\\n`TimeSeries.fill()` will be the common entry point for the `Filler`, but a `Pipeline` can be constructed as well. Even though the default behavior of `TimeSeries.fill()` applies to all fill methods, the `linear` fill logic is somewhat different than the `zero` and `pad` methods. Note the following points when creating your own `method: 'linear'` processing chain.\\n\\n* When constructing a `Pipeline` to do a `linear` fill on multiple columns, chain them together like this rather than passing in a `field_spec` that is a list of columns:\\n```\\n    const pipeline = Pipeline()\\n        .fromSource(ts)\\n        .fill({fieldSpec: \\\"direction.in\\\", method: \\\"linear\\\"})\\n        .fill(fieldSpec: \\\"direction.out\\\", method: \\\"linear\\\"})\\n        .toKeyedCollections()\\n```\\n* If a non numeric value is encountered when doing a `linear` fill, a console.warn will be issued and that column will not be processed.\\n* When using an unbounded input (like `Stream`), it is a best practice to set a limit using the optional `limit`. This will ensure events will continue being emitted if the data hits a long run of missing values.\\n* When using an streaming source, make sure to shut it down \\\"cleanly\\\" using `.stop()`. This will ensure `.flush()` is called so any unfilled cached events are emitted.\\n\\n### Alignment of data\\n\\nThe align processor takes a `TimeSeries` of events that might come in with timestamps at uneven intervals and produces a new series of those points are aligned on precise time window boundaries.  A series containing four events with following timestamps:\\n\\n```\\n0:40\\n1:05\\n1:45\\n2:10\\n```\\n\\nGiven a period of `1m` (every one minute), a new series with two events at the following times will be produced:\\n\\n```\\n1:00\\n2:00\\n```\\n\\nOnly a series of `Event` objects can be aligned. `IndexedEvent` objects are basically already aligned and it makes no sense in the case of a `TimeRangeEvent`.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that the emitted/aligned event will only contain the fields that alignment was requested on. Which is to say if you have two columns, `in` and `out`, and only request to align the `in` column, the `out` value will not be contained in the emitted event.\\n\\n#### Usage\\n\\nThe full argument usage of the align method:\\n\\n```\\n    const ts = TimeSeries(data)\\n    const aligned = ts.align({\\n        fieldSpec: [\\\"in\\\", \\\"out\\\"],\\n        period: \\\"1m\\\",\\n        method: \\\"linear\\\",\\n        limit: 2\\n    });\\n```\\n\\n* `fieldSpec` - indicates which fields should be interpolated by the selected `method`. Typical usage of this option type. If not supplied, then the default field `value` will be used.\\n* `period` - an integer and the usual `s/m/h/d` notation like `1m`, `30s`, `6h`, etc. The emitted events will be emitted on the indicated boundaries. Due to the nature of the interpolation, one would want to use a window close to the frequency of the events. It would make little sense to set a window of `5h` on hourly data, etc.\\n* `method` - the interpolation method to be used: `linear` (the default) and `hold`.\\n* `limit` - sets a limit on the number of boundary interpolated events will be produced. If `limit: 2, period: '1m'` and two events come in at the following times:\\n\\n```\\n0:45\\n3:15\\n```\\n\\nThat would normally produce events on three alignment boundaries `1:00, 2:00 and 3:00` and that exceeds the `limit` so those events will have `null` as a value instead of an interpolated value.\\n\\n#### Interpolation methods\\n\\n##### Linear\\n\\nThis is the default method. It uses simple linear interpolation between values in `Event` objects to derive new values on to the alignment boundaries. Interpolation occurs between the last event before the boundary and the first point after. Interpolation can occur across multiple boundaries at once.\\n\\n##### Hold\\n\\nThis is a much simpler method. It just fills the selected field(s) with the corresponding value from the previous event.\\n\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 178 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"## Processing pipelines\\n---\\n\\nIn this guide we dig into the processing capabilities of Pond.\\n\\nWhile Pond started life as a data structure library, as it grew up we discovered that we needed the ability to perform operations on the data structures we had built. We started with simple functions such as asking a TimeSeries for its average value for a given column. Then we added functions for splitting and composing TimeSeries back together. Then we wanted to do more complicated things like filtering, fill missing values, or aggregating events over time windows.\\n\\nAs a parallel requirement we were interested in providing a TimeSeries orientated approach to processing data on the cloud. Our first venture into this was with AWS Kinesis, which we wanted to process events in TimeSeries specific ways and then output new events as a result.\\n\\nFrom the need for better framework to build up our TimeSeries processing capabilities, combined with our need to process streams of events, grew a pipeline mechanism in Pond.\\n\\n### Pipelines\\n\\nThe Pipeline was developed as an event processing chain from the beginning. Events are passed in the top and new events are emitted at the bottom. All processing operations that a chain can produce are carried out this way.\\n\\nA pipeline is composed of three parts: an input, a chain of processors, and an output. Let's take those one at a time.\\n\\n#### Sources\\n\\nAn input source can be something like a TimeSeries itself, some other bounded source, such as a file, or a stream.\\n\\nIf the input is a stream, then that source will inject events into the processing chain. The built in `Stream` is a basic stream where the user can `addEvent()` to it manually and those events are forwarded into the processing chain. A more sophisticated streaming source might be collecting events off a PubSub subscription and injecting events into the processing chain automatically. Here's a simple example:\\n\\n```\\n    const stream = new Stream();\\n\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(stream)\\n        .to(CollectionOut, c => out = c);\\n\\n    stream.addEvent(evt1);\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\nIf the input is a bounded source, then events will be created by traversing the source from beginning to end, with each event in the source injected down the processing chain. This happens when an output is attached to the chain, not when the source is defined on the pipeline. As the output is attached a chain is constructed from the path of nodes leading back from the output to the source and events are batched though this chain until complete, with the result accumulated at the output.\\n\\nFinally, if the input is a TimeSeries, this is just a special case of a bounded source.\\n\\n```\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(timeseries)\\n        .select(\\\"in\\\")\\n        .to(CollectionOut, c => result = new TimeSeries({name: \\\"newTimeseries\\\", collection: c}));\\n```\\n\\n#### Processing chains\\n\\nPond contains a growing collection of processing nodes. These nodes are constructed using chained methods on the pipeline itself. You do not need to initialize the processing nodes themselves manually. However, it's worth understanding that behind the scenes you are constructing a chain of processing nodes.\\n\\nAll processing nodes take incoming events and output new events. Events may be Pond TimeEvents, TimeRangeEvents or IndexedEvents, depending on the type of processor. For instance if you calculate the `rate()` (change over time) between incoming events, the output will be a TimeRangeEvent because the rate value applies to a time range. Events can be converted within the chain using the Converter node (`pipeline.asTimeEvents()`, `pipeline.asTimeRangeEvents()` and `pipeline.asIndexedEvents()`).\\n\\nCurrent processors:\\n\\n * **aggregate** - take a collection of events (defined by a group, or all events) and aggregate them down to a single event\\n * **align** - interpolate events onto regular time boundaries (e.g. every 30 seconds)\\n * **collapse** - take event fields and reduce them down to a single field using some reducer function\\n * **fill** - fill in missing values in events (e.g. replace null values with linearly interpolated values from neighbor events)\\n * **filter** - remove events from the stream using a filter function\\n * **map** - remap an event's data to new data\\n * **select** - select out certain fields in events\\n * **take** - only allow a limited number of events to pass through the chain\\n \\nIn addition to defining the processing nodes via chained calls to the `pipeline` you can also set several types of state. For instance you can set a groupBy state (with `pipeline.groupBy()`) and this grouping will be held as state within the pipeline until a processing node needs to respect that. In this case an aggregation would respect that and output its result per grouping. States can be reset or changed further down the pipeline.\\n\\nTypes of state:\\n\\n * **groupBy** - define a way for future processors to group events together\\n * **windowBy** - define a window (e.g. every 5 minutes) to group events\\n * **emitOn** - define when events should be emitted from aggregations (e.g. on every event, or only when events move to the next window).\\n\\n#### Output\\n\\nThere are two general mechanisms for collecting the output of the processing chain. The first to be implemented was a callback style interface which let you provide a function that would be called with the result. Currently you can either output events or collections:\\n\\n```\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(stream)\\n        .to(EventOut, event => {/* do something with event */});\\n```\\n\\n```\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(stream)\\n        .to(CollectionOut, collection => {/* do something with collection */});\\n```\\n\\nIn some cases this is a very natural interface for an event processing chain like this one, and handles the case of the input being async or dealing with an ongoing stream perfectly. However, in many of our use cases, it was burdensome to place the users code into a callback when the pipeline was operating on a synchronous source anyway, such as a simple TimeSeries. So we added an alternative.\\n\\nIt is also possible to accumulate the result back on the pipeline itself and then return the result directly from the chain. To do this, use the outputs `Pipeline.toKeyedCollections()` and `Pipeline.toEventList()`. For example:\\n\\n```\\n    const collections = Pipeline()\\n        .from(timeseries)\\n        ...\\n        .toKeyedCollections();\\n```\\n\\nHere the result is returned from the Pipeline chain, rather than the Pipeline object itself. This therefore ends the chain.\\n\\nAlso note: that this will not work with an async source!\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 179 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"## Rollup example\\n---\\nIn this example we have an simulated incoming stream of measurements, represented by the dots. The visualization you see shows the 5 min aggregations (both 50th and 90th percentile) of the incoming stream as a green bar chart. We calculate this as described below.\\n\\n### Events\\n\\nTo do this, each event is generated semi-randomly, but they could be coming from a real source. We add a new Event for each minute, but emit 5 per second to speed up the simulation. Essentially we do this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { TimeEvent } from \\\"pondjs\\\";\\n\\nconst value = getRandomValue();\\nconst time = getNextTime();\\nconst event = new TimeEvent(t, value);\\n```\\n\\nNow we want to do some things with that Event:\\n\\n * Store it, so we can show the scatter plot\\n * Aggregate it to give us our 5 min average and maximum values\\n\\nTo store it, we put it into a circle buffer that keeps the last n Events. Otherwise we'll eventually kill the browser. The circle buffer is placed in the React component's state.\\n\\n### Aggregation\\n\\nFor the more interesting part, the aggregation, we need to setup up a couple of Pond Pipelines to do the work. Here's the 5 min aggregator that we setup:\\n\\n```js\\n\\nimport { Stream, Pipeline, EventOut, percentile } from \\\"pondjs\\\";\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst stream = new Stream();\\n\\nPipeline()\\n    .from(stream)\\n    .windowBy(\\\"5m\\\")\\n    .emitOn(\\\"discard\\\")\\n    .aggregate({\\n        value: {value: percentile(90)}\\n    })\\n    .to(EventOut, event => {\\n        // store the output events in our component state\\n    });\\n```\\n\\nThe Pipeline now just needs a feed of events added to the `stream` in order to process them into a new aggregated events. Each time one of these new events is emitted we take that from the callback defined in `to()` and place it into the component's state.\\n\\n\\n```js\\nstream.addEvent(event);\\n```\\n\\n### Visualization with React\\n\\nThe first thing we need to do is turn our three event lists (the original events along with the two aggregated event streams) into `TimeSeries` objects which can then be passed to our charting code. Since we can construct `TimeSeries` object from a list of `Event`s, this is simply a matter of pulling the list from the circle buffer and giving it to the `TimeSeries` constructor.\\n\\nFor example, our 5 minute 50th percentiles:\\n\\n```js\\nconst name = \\\"5m-percentile-50\\\";\\nconst events = this.state.perc50Out.toArray(); // <- from circle buffer\\nconst avgSeries = new TimeSeries({name, events});\\n```\\n\\nNext we figure out the begin and end times for the chart. The chart expands outward until it gets to 3 hours and then pans with the new data. Once we calculate the beginTime and endTime we make a TimeRange to represent this range:\\n\\n```js\\nconst timeRange = new TimeRange(beginTime, endTime);\\n```\\n\\nFinally we `render()` the chart:\\n\\n```jsx\\n    render() {\\n        return (\\n            <ChartContainer timeRange={timeRange}>\\n                <ChartRow height=\\\"150\\\">\\n                    <YAxis\\n                        id=\\\"y\\\"\\n                        label=\\\"Value\\\"\\n                        min={0} max={1500}\\n                        type=\\\"linear\\\" />\\n                    <Charts>\\n                        <BarChart\\n                            axis=\\\"y\\\"\\n                            series={avgSeries}\\n                            columns={[\\\"value\\\"]} />\\n                        <BarChart\\n                            axis=\\\"y\\\"\\n                            series={maxSeries}\\n                            columns={[\\\"value\\\"]} />\\n                        <ScatterChart\\n                            axis=\\\"y\\\"\\n                            series={rawSeries} />\\n                    </Charts>\\n                </ChartRow>\\n            </ChartContainer>\\n        );\\n    }\\n```\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 180 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"## Getting started\\n\\n---\\n\\nPond will run in node.js or in the browser.

As we head there will be some breaking changes and this release includes some of these, so please read the section on Important Breaking Changes below to see what needs to be changed. Sorry!\\n\\n**Important breaking changes:**\\n\\n * `Event` -> `TimeEvent` (except static Event methods)\\n * Removed `atTime()` and `bisect()` from the Collection API, because these depend on an ordered list and should live on the TimeSeries.\\n * Removed the convenience static methods that wrapped `timeSeriesListReduce()`, specifically `timeSeriesListSum()` and `timeSeriesListAvg()`, use `timeSeriesListReduce()` now with whatever reducer function you want (e.g. `sum()`)\\n * `Event.sum()` and `Event.avg()` are removed. Use `Event.combine()` instead.\\n\\n**Features and changes:**\\n\\n * **TimeSeries merging**: Improves performance for merging and combining TimeSeries events up to 10 times (Fixes [#51](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/51)).\\n * **TimeSeries merging API** TimeSeries level API has been simplified, allowing any reducer function (e.g. `avg()` to be used when combining multiple TimeSeries, but removing some wrapper functions (see breaking changes below). (Fixes [#58](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/58), [#59](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/59))\\n * **Event class hierarchy**: The event class structure was finally cleaned up internally, but this comes with a major breaking change: events that were of class `Event` before (i.e. had a timestamp) are now `TimeEvents`, while `Event` is a base class shared by `TimeEvent`, `TimeRangeEvent` and `IndexedEvent`. Further, `Events` can now be further sub-classed (see Avro change for why). Static event methods are still on `Event`.\\n * **Avro support**. Along with the ability to subclass an `Event` comes the ability to define a schema for the subclass. This allows `Event`s, `TimeSeries` and `TimeRange`s to serialize themselves to Avro buffers for compact and correct transfers. This feature is still experimental, and isn't currently supported in PyPond.\\n * **De-duplication** - you can now de-duplicate the events in a `Collection` with `Collection.dedup()`. Later events win. In a related change you can use `collection.atKey()` to get back a list of events at that exact time, timerange or index, or a map of key to a list of events at that key with `eventListAsMap()`. This partially addresses [#52](https://github.com/esnet/pond/issues/52).\\n * **Prettier** - Uses prettier for code formatting now, so lots of stylistic changes in this release. Hopefully this will simplify that part of code maintenance going forward.\\n\\n\\n## v0.7.1\\n> October 2016\\n\\nPatch release to fix several bugs and improve performance:\\n- renaming columns now does so with mapKeys, rather than breaking the whole thing apart\\n- fixes merging of TimeSeries so that if the result isn't chronological then it will sort them before trying to make a new TimeSeries\\n- fixes atTime() boundary condition (#45)\\n- fixed align processors to handle initial events that are already aligned\\n- internal calls to setCollection can skip the isChronological test with a flag since they know they are maintaining order.\\n\\n## v0.7\\n> September 2016\\n\\nThis update had three main goals:\\n - Better handling of imperfect data.\\n - Add quantile and percentile calculations\\n - Improve API consistency\\n\\nIn addition, PyPond is now available with feature parity to the pond.js.\\n\\nBreaking changes to look out for: `Pipeline.aggregate()` has changed to allow better composition of emitted events, aggregation functions are now supplied as `avg()` rather than simple `avg`. And `UnboundedIns` are now simply `Stream`.\\n\\n**General:**\\n\\n -  Consistent use of fieldSpec, fieldPath etc across the API.\\n -  Aggregation functions now all need to be specified as `avg()` rather than `avg`. i.e. they are now a function that returns a function. This is to allow them to take parameters. e.g `percentile(95)`.\\n -  * All aggregation functions now accept a strategy for dealing with missing values. Missing values in pond.js are `NaN`s, `null`, or `undefined`. Strategies added are:\\n    - `keepMissing` - pass through all values to the aggregator\\n    - `ignoreMissing` - pass though only non-missing values\\n    - `zeroMissing` - turn missing values into 0\\n    - `propagateMissing` - cause the aggregator to return null if there is a missing value\\n\\n**Collection:**\\n\\n - Adds `quantile()` and `percentile()` aggregation functions\\n\\n**TimeSeries:**\\n\\n - Adds quantile and percentile aggregation functions\\n - Fixed: better handling of UTC times when generating IndexedEvent results\\n - More mutation support:\\n    - Added `renameColumns()` to deep rename Events within a TimeSeries\\n    - Added `setName()` to change the name of a TimeSeries\\n    - Added `setMeta(key, value)` to change the meta data in a TimeSeries\\n  In each case you will get a new TimeSeries back.\\n - Added `fill()` method to fill in missing values within a TimeSeries, using 0s, padding (last good value) or linear interpolation. In each case you can also specify a limit to the fill\\n - Added `align()` method to interpolate data to specific time boundaries (e.g. every 5 minutes). The interpolation can be with last value or linear interpolation. Like fill, a limit can also be supplied.\\n - Added `rate()` method to return the derivative of the TimeSeries. Optionally you can ignore negative values.\\n\\n**Pipelines:**\\n\\n - Support for`fill()`, `align()` and `rate()` within a Pipeline.\\n - `UnboundedIn` is now `Stream`.\\n - Changes `aggregation` to more explicitly define the output fields. This allows you to perform multiple aggregations on the same input field, such as aggregating temperature over a collection window to average_temp and max_temp.\\n\\nBefore:\\n```\\nconst p = Pipeline()\\n  ...\\n  .aggregate({in: avg, out: avg})\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nAfter:\\n```\\nconst p = Pipeline()\\n  ...\\n  .aggregate({\\n      in: {in: keep()},\\n      in_avg: {in: avg()},\\n      in_95th: {in: percentile(95)}}\\n  })\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n - As shown in the above example, you can use the `percentile()` function. Note that this is a little different from the others in that you need to call the function with the percentile value you want. A second parameter controls the way the function behaves when a percentile does not land on a specific sample. The default is to linearly interpolate.\\n - Fixes a bug where Pipeline.taker() would ignore the first event.\\n\\n**Internal**\\n\\n - Website now built with create-react-app\\n - Tests use Jest now and run in the terminal (for create-react-app workflow)\\n - General project restructuring\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.6\\n\\nThis update concentrates on providing a better API for processing a TimeSeries object. It updates the Pipeline code to be able to return the results as an alternative to evoking a callback function. Using this API several methods on the TimeSeries have been reworked to directly return their results as a new TimeSeries. In addition, TimeSeries now has several new methods to do roll-ups aggregations and collections directly.\\n\\n**TimeSeries**\\n\\nConstruction:\\n - a TimeSeries is now checked for chronological events and the code will throw if there is. This is because there are several methods on the TimeSeries that will produce incorrect results if this is the case and it is far from intuitive why.\\n\\nWith the change to the batch API we can now greatly simplify several methods on TimeSeries. These three methods now directly return a new TimeSeries:\\n - `map()`\\n - `select()`\\n - `collapse()`.\\n\\nNew methods that use Pipelines internally to perform common roll-up processing of TimeSeries:\\n - `fixedWindowRollup()`\\n - `hourlyRollup()`\\n - `dailyRollup()`\\n - `monthlyRollup()`\\n - `yearlyRollup()`\\n - `collectByFixedWindow()` - to build a map of new Collections given a fixed window (like \\\"5m\\\"). The result is a map from the window name (e.g. \\\"5m-12345\\\") to a Collection. This is essentially tiling the TimeSeries.\\n\\nAdditional new methods:\\n - `crop()` - you could always use slice() but this is simpler. Just give it a TimeRange and you get back a new TimeSeries.\\n - `atTime()`, `atFirst()`, `atLast()` and  `* events()` generator - Convenience methods so you don't have to go through the TimeSeries' Collection.\\n\\n**Pipelines:**\\n\\nImplements #22 - when processing a synchronous source we can just accumulate the result (either EventList or CollectionMap) on the Pipeline and return that result directly. This enables methods to be built on TimeSeries, for example, that can simply return a new TimeSeries and not dump the user into a callback or force them to guess if they can assume the function will be called synchronously. See #22 for a more detailed discussion about this. Note: This is pretty experimental and there's no facility to cope with an async source at the moment. In that case there just won't be a return value and no warning or error will be given. We don't currently use such a source, but others might. Regardless, this API extension is not appropriate in that case.\\n\\nAdds two new methods to a Pipeline() to expose this to the Pipeline user:\\n - `toCollectionMap()` - maps a mapping of the key of the collection to the Collection itself. The key comes from a combination of the groupBy() and windowBy() directives on the Pipeline. The key is determined like this:\\n    - If there isn't a window or group key, the collection will output to \\\"all\\\" -> collection.\\n    - If one type of grouping, that grouping will be used. window name or group by.\\n    - If both, they will be concatenated together with a \\\"--\\\".\\n - `toEventList()` - puts every event output into a list.\\n\\nWindowing changes:\\n - `clearWindow()` - remove the window, i.e. reset to a global window\\n - `clearGroupBy()` - remove the groupby setting\\n - \\\"daily\\\", \\\"monthly\\\" and \\\"yearly\\\" window types are now supported\\n - If building with a non-fixed or non-global window, we build IndexedEvents with local time. We could possibly allow the user to determine this but this is probably the best default behavior. (note, there's no tests for this. This is rather hard to test with JS)\\n\\nOther bug fixes:\\n - Fixes a bug where a Converter would not work correctly in batch mode because it wasn't being cloned correctly.\\n\\n**Collection:**\\n\\nConstruction:\\n - Require the type to be passed in when constructing with an Immutable.List (Fixes #16). This is generally only used internally.\\n\\nNew methods:\\n - `isChronological()` - return if a Collection's events are chronological.\\n - `sortByTime()` - Reorder Collection events to be chronological.\\n\\n**Index:**\\n\\nStatic functions to build an Index strings for daily, monthly and yearly rollups:\\n - `getDailyIndexString()`\\n - `getMonthlyIndexString()`\\n - `getYearlyIndexString()`\\n\\n**IndexedEvents:**\\n - Fixes a bug where the UTC flag was not being correctly set on IndexedEvents.\\n\\n**Collector:**\\n - Ability to collect based on daily, monthly or yearly buckets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.5\\n\\nLarge update causing many API changes, especially within what was previously the Processor pipeline (now Pipeline). The core structures such as Events and TimeSeries remain largely the same, at least from an API perspective, with mostly feature additions and bug fixes. We are still evolving the pipeline code but feel this is a significant step forward and one which we can build on going forward.\\n\\n### v0.5.0\\n\\n * Pipeline is a complete rewrite of the Processing code. It now unifies operations on sets of Events into a Collection class that also backs the TimeSeries itself. This enables the pipelines to operate on either streams of Events or on TimeSeries or Collections.\\n * Pipelines therefore support a limited notion of either streaming or batch processing.\\n * Pipelines support fixed window aggregations as well as general grouping by key or function\\n * Pipeline operators:\\n   - select() for choosing specific event fields\\n   - collapse() for collapsing specific event fields using a reducer\\n   - map() for doing element-wise transformations of events\\n   - filter() for conditionally removing events based on a filter function\\n   - take() for accepting only the first n events through the pipeline, for a given window and key\\n   - count() for counting up events that fall within a given window and key\\n   - aggregate() for building new aggregated events from collections based on the given window and key\\n   - converters for converting between event types\\n  * Pipeline simple triggers for each event, each collection discard and on flush using emitOn()\\n  * Pipeline output support using to() for emitting Collections and Events\\n  * Pipeline input support using from() for Collections, TimeSeries, or UnboundedIns.\\n * Event access using get() allows use of fieldSpecs, which can be fieldNames or dot delimited paths to deeper data\\n * Events no longer have a key. Groupby keys ares managed by the pipeline itself now\\n * TimeRange: fixes lastYear() static function\\n * TimeSeries: fixes duplicate size() definition\\n * TimeSeries and Collection: first() and last() are aggregation functions now, while atFirst() and atLast() returns the first/last event in the series/collection\\n * Project\\n    - Updated to Babel 6\\n    - Added code coverage\\n    - Auto-build of docs for website\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.4\\n\\n### v0.4.2\\n\\n * Fixed creation of a `TimeSeries` from `TimeRangeEvents`.\\n * Fixed `timerange()` calculation of a `TimeSeries` made of `TimeRangeEvents`.\\n\\n### v0.4.1\\n\\n * Fixed TimeSeries import\\n\\n### v0.4.0\\n\\n * Support for processing chains. e.g.\\n \\n```\\n    const processor = Processor()\\n        .groupBy(\\\"channelName\\\")\\n        .aggregate(\\\"5m\\\", avg)\\n        .collect(\\\"1d\\\", false, timeseries => {\\n            // --> Output timeseries representing 1 day of 5 min averages\\n        });\\n```\\n\\n * `Aggregators` and `collector` now support emitting events \\\"always\\\", and not just when the \\\"next\\\" bucket is created\\n * Processing function API has been cleaned up. To flush events, use `flush()` (`done()` and `sync()` are gone)\\n * Event internals are now an Immutable.map rather than using member variables that could be modified\\n * Events support keys to enable the ability to do groupBy operations. You can add a key to an `Event` with `setKey()`, and you'll get a new `Event` back which is the same as the old one, but with a key. You can query the key with, unsurprisingly, `key()`.\\n * `Groupers` are a new `Event` processor which takes an incoming event stream and emits the same event but with a key on it. This enables downstream processing, such as aggregation, to group based on the key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.3\\n\\n### v0.3.0\\n\\n * Better support for nested objects:\\n    * Converts deeper structures to Immutable objects internally\\n    * Added \\\"value functions\\\" to operations that deal with columns of values so that you can pull out internals of nested structures.\\n    * Event's get() function will convert deep Immutable structures to JS objects.\\n * You can now use either value() or get() to get a value out of an Event.\\n * Added ability to convert to time based Events when inserting IndexedEvents into a collection. This can be much faster to query.\\n * Began work on ability to do things like sum a series or isolate columns of a series.\\n * Website update as well as uniform linting\\n\\n---\\n\\n## v0.2\\n\\n### v0.2.1\\n\\n * Fixed an issue with merge.\\n\\n### v0.2.0\\n\\n * You can either merge two series with different columns together, or same columns and different times.\\n\\n```\\nconst trafficSeries = TimeSeries.merge(\\\"traffic\\\", [inTraffic, outTraffic]);\\n```\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./CHANGES.md\n ** module id = 165\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<a name=\\\"Collection\\\"></a>\\n\\n## Collection\\nA collection is an abstraction for a bag of Events.\\n\\nYou typically construct a Collection from a list of Events, which\\nmay be either within an Immutable.List or an Array.

There are two basic types:\\n*Multiplier index* - the number of some unit of time (hours, days etc) since the UNIX epoch.\\n*Calendar index* - The second represents a calendar range, such as Oct 2014.\\n\\nFor the first type, a multiplier index, an example might be:\\n\\n```text\\n    1d-12355      //  30th Oct 2003 (GMT), the 12355th day since the UNIX epoch\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use seconds (e.g. 30s), minutes (e.g. 5m), hours (e.g. 1h) or days (e.g. 7d).\\n\\nHere are several examples of a calendar index:\\n\\n```text\\n    2003-10-30    // 30th Oct 2003\\n    2014-09       // Sept 2014\\n    2015          // All of the year 2015\\n```\\n\\nAn Index is a nice representation of certain types of time intervals because it can be cached with its string representation as a key. A specific chunk of time, and associated data can be looked up based on that string. It also allows us to represent things like months, which have variable length.\\n\\nAn Index is also useful when collecting into specific time ranges, for example generating all the 5 min (\\\"5m\\\") maximum rollups within a specific day (\\\"1d\\\").

Alternatively you can call `toJSON()`\\nto return a Javascript object representation of the data, while\\n`toString()` will serialize the entire event to a string.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nGiven some source of data that looks like this:\\n\\n```json\\nconst event = {\\n    \\\"start_time\\\": \\\"2015-04-22T03:30:00Z\\\",\\n    \\\"end_time\\\": \\\"2015-04-22T13:00:00Z\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"At 13:33 pacific circuit 06519 went down.\\\",\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"STAR-CR5 - Outage\\\",\\n    \\\"completed\\\": true,\\n    \\\"external_ticket\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"esnet_ticket\\\": \\\"ESNET-20150421-013\\\",\\n    \\\"organization\\\": \\\"Internet2 / Level 3\\\",\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"U\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe first extract the begin and end times to build a TimeRange:\\n\\n```js\\nlet b = new Date(event.start_time);\\nlet e = new Date(event.end_time);\\nlet timerange = new TimeRange(b, e);\\n```\\n\\nThen we combine the TimeRange and the event itself to create the Event.\\n\\n```js\\nlet outageEvent = new TimeRangeEvent(timerange, sampleEvent);\\n```\\n\\nOnce we have an event we can get access the time range with:\\n\\n```js\\noutageEvent.begin().getTime()   // 1429673400000\\noutageEvent.end().getTime())    // 1429707600000\\noutageEvent.humanizeDuration()) // \\\"10 hours\\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd we can access the data like so:\\n\\n```js\\noutageEvent.get(\\\"title\\\")  // \\\"STAR-CR5 - Outage\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Kind**: global class  \\n\\n* [TimeRangeEvent](#TimeRangeEvent)\\n    * [new TimeRangeEvent()](#new_TimeRangeEvent_new)\\n    * _instance_\\n        * [.key()](#TimeRangeEvent+key)\\n        * [.toJSON()](#TimeRangeEvent+toJSON)\\n        * [.toPoint()](#TimeRangeEvent+toPoint)\\n        * [.timerange()](#TimeRangeEvent+timerange) ⇒ <code>[TimeRange](#TimeRange)</code>\\n        * [.timerangeAsUTCString()](#TimeRangeEvent+timerangeAsUTCString) ⇒ <code>string</code>\\n        * [.timerangeAsLocalString()](#TimeRangeEvent+timerangeAsLocalString) ⇒ <code>string</code>\\n        * [.begin()](#TimeRangeEvent+begin) ⇒ <code>Data</code>\\n        * [.end()](#TimeRangeEvent+end) ⇒ <code>Data</code>\\n        * [.timestamp()](#TimeRangeEvent+timestamp) ⇒ <code>Data</code>\\n        * [.humanizeDuration()](#TimeRangeEvent+humanizeDuration)\\n    * _static_\\n        * [.keySchema()](#TimeRangeEvent.keySchema)\\n\\n<a name=\\\"new_TimeRangeEvent_new\\\"></a>\\n\\n### new TimeRangeEvent()\\nThe creation of an TimeRangeEvent is done by combining two parts:\\nthe timerange and the data.\\n\\nTo construct you specify a TimeRange, along with the data.\\n\\nTo specify the data you can supply either:\\n    - a Javascript object containing key values pairs\\n    - an Immutable.Map, or\\n    - a simple type such as an integer.

Each row is at a different time (or timerange), and each value corresponds to the column labels.\\n\\nAs just hinted at, the first column may actually be:\\n\\n - \\\"time\\\"\\n - \\\"timeRange\\\" represented by a `TimeRange`\\n - \\\"index\\\" - a time range represented by an `Index`. By using an index it is possible, for example, to refer to a specific month:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst availabilityData = {\\n    name: \\\"Last 3 months availability\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"index\\\", \\\"uptime\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [\\\"2015-06\\\", \\\"100%\\\"], // <-- 2015-06 specified here represents June 2015\\n        [\\\"2015-05\\\", \\\"92%\\\"],\\n        [\\\"2015-04\\\", \\\"87%\\\"],\\n    ]\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can construct a `TimeSeries` with a list of events.\\nThese may be `TimeEvents`, `TimeRangeEvents` or `IndexedEvents`. Here's an example of that:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst events = [];\\nevents.push(new TimeEvent(new Date(2015, 7, 1), {value: 27}));\\nevents.push(new TimeEvent(new Date(2015, 8, 1), {value: 29}));\\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\\n    name: \\\"avg temps\\\",\\n    events: events\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Nested data\\n\\nThe values do not have to be simple types like the above examples. Here's an\\nexample where each value is itself an object with \\\"in\\\" and \\\"out\\\" keys:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst series = new TimeSeries({\\n    name: \\\"Map Traffic\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"NASA_north\\\", \\\"NASA_south\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [1400425951000, {in: 100, out: 200}, {in: 145, out: 135}],\\n        [1400425952000, {in: 200, out: 400}, {in: 146, out: 142}],\\n        [1400425953000, {in: 300, out: 600}, {in: 147, out: 158}],\\n        [1400425954000, {in: 400, out: 800}, {in: 155, out: 175}],\\n    ]\\n});\\n```\\n\\nComplex data is stored in an Immutable structure. To get a value out of nested\\ndata like this you will get the event you want (by row), as usual, and then use\\n`get()` to fetch the value by column name. The result of this call will be a\\nJSON copy of the Immutable data so you can query deeper in the usual way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nseries.at(0).get(\\\"NASA_north\\\")[\\\"in\\\"]  // 200`\\n```\\n\\nIt is then possible to use a value mapper function when calculating different\\nproperties. For example, to get the average \\\"in\\\" value of the NASA_north column:\\n\\n```javascript\\nseries.avg(\\\"NASA_north\\\", d => d.in);  // 250\\n```\\n\\n**Kind**: global class  \\n\\n*

These counters generally increases monotonically. In this example we combine the alignment with the rate function to get a TimeSeries of network traffic (e.g. bits per second).\\n\\nWhile this example relates to network traffic, it could also apply to click streams, etc.\\n\\nData we get from the network is requested every 30 seconds from the routers. This is done with SNMP, a network management protocol. The response from the network arrives some time shortly after the request. At this point we timestamp the value because it is the most representative time we can come up with (the router does not timestamp the response). As a result, we typically find our incoming data events to be approximately every 30 seconds, but not quite. We might have values at 1:31, 2:02, 2:31, 3:04, etc.\\n\\nIn addition to this, we experience missing points from time to time (in the order of a handful per day) and we also experience counter reset where the counter reaches a numerical limit and resets itself.\\n\\nThe problem with this is that it makes downstream processing much harder to deal with.\\n\\nPond has several useful features to address this data ingestion problem. In pond.js, data can be processed as a stream (though a naive one that doesn't have mechanisms for dealing with out of order data), or as a batch process on a bounded source such as a TimeSeries. In either case we might want to use Pond to manage our situation.\\n\\n## Preparing the data\\n\\nLet's say we want to write a batch task to do this, where we read approximately a days data from some storage to process.\\n\\nOur initial goal is to collect our data into a `TimeSeries` object. From there we can process it either with the built in methods or by feeding it through a pipeline.\\n\\nTo collect data into a TimeSeries object we would generally map it from our native format into an object such as the following:\\n\\n```js\\n    const trafficData = {\\n        name: \\\"ames-lab-traffic\\\",\\n        columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"in\\\"],\\n        points: [\\n            [[1468886425000, 30149747500170],\\n            [1468886456000, 30149754529057],\\n            [1468886487000, 30149765964686],\\n            [1468886517000, 30149774808349],\\n            [1468886548000, 30149786620883],\\n            [1468886578000, 30149797218334],\\n            [1468886609000, 30149806694886],\\n            [1468886639000, 30149814247765],\\n            [1468886640000, null],\\n            [1468886670000, 30149836244496],\\n            [1468886700000, 30149845139313],\\n            [1468886731000, 30149853210590],\\n            [1468886761000, 30149861469019]\\n            ...],\\n        ]\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nAnd then construct a TimeSeries from that:\\n\\n```js\\n    const traffic = new TimeSeries(trafficData);\\n```\\n\\n## Alignment\\n\\nNext we want to get our data onto exact 30 second boundaries. This is now a simple task of calling the align() function on the TimeSeries.\\n\\n```js\\n    const aligned = traffic.align({\\n        fieldSpec: \\\"in\\\",\\n        period: \\\"30s\\\",\\n        method: \\\"linear\\\",\\n        limit: 2\\n    });\\n```\\n\\nSome things to note here: firstly, we refer to the \\\"in\\\" column with the fieldSpec. If we had both the \\\"in\\\" and \\\"out\\\" values in our TimeSeries we could have used a fieldSpec of [\\\"in\\\", \\\"out\\\"]. Secondly, we specify the alignment boundaries with the period, in this case we want to align the data to our 30 second request rate. Thirdly, we use \\\"linear\\\" interpolation to determine the value of the counter (\\\"in\\\" value) at the boundaries. And finally, we set a limit to 2. This will cause minor gaps in the data to be filled, while larger outages are left null.\\n\\n## Rate (derivative)\\n\\nFinally, we want to calculate the traffic rate from the growing counter value.\\n\\nTimeSeries has a method for this too: rate(). It generates a new `TimeSeries` of `TimeRangeEvent` objects which contain the derivative between columns in two consecutive `Event` objects. The start and end time of the time range events correspond to the timestamps of the two events the calculation was derived from.\\n\\nThe primary use case for this was to generate rate data from monotonically increasing SNMP counter values like this:\\n\\n```js\\n    const baseRate = aligned.rate({fieldSpec: \\\"in\\\", allowNegative: false});\\n```\\n\\nNow we have the `baseRate` as a TimeSeries. We've taken our raw counter data, done a linearly interpolated alignment to 30 second boundaries, and then calculate the rates by calculating the derivative between the aligned boundaries.\\n\\nNote that we also passed in `allowNegative` to be false. This will replace a negative change in the counter value to output a null instead of a rate. You could then use `fill()` to fill in that point, or leave it as a missing value.\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./src/website/guides/counters.md\n ** module id = 174\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"## Glossary\\n---\\n\\nThis guide contains a description of terms that are specific to Pond. Please let us know if there are terms in the API or documentation that need further explanation and we will update this document.\\n\\n---\\n### Alignment\\n\\nThis refers to taking a sequence of data that may be irregular in timestamps and converting that to fall on specific time boundaries. For instance you could have data at 1:31, 2:01, 2:34, and 3:01 and would like to align this to exact 30s boundaries (1:30, 2:00, 2:30, and 3:00). Pond can do this with `TimeSeries.align()` or in a Pipeline, with a variety of options for how the incoming data is interpolated to the aligned output.\\n\\n---\\n### Collapsing\\n\\nThis is the process of taking multiple columns of data and turning it into a single column.\\n\\n---\\n### Fields: fieldSpec and fieldPath\\n\\nThere are some points to note about the nomenclature that the `pypond` and `pond` code bases use to refer to the \\\"columns of data\\\" in the time series event objects. This `TimeSeries`:\\n\\n```\\nconst DATA = {\\n    name: \\\"traffic\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"value\\\", \\\"status\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [1400425947000, 52, \\\"ok\\\"],\\n        [1400425948000, 18, \\\"ok\\\"],\\n        [1400425949000, 26, \\\"fail\\\"],\\n        [1400425950000, 93, \\\"offline\\\"]\\n    ]\\n};\\n```\\n\\ncontains two **columns**: `value` and `status`.\\n\\nHowever this `TimeSeries`:\\n\\n```\\nconst DATA_FLOW = {\\n    name: \\\"traffic\\\",\\n    columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"direction\\\"],\\n    points: [\\n        [1400425947000, {'in': 1, 'out': 2}],\\n        [1400425948000, {'in': 3, 'out': 4}],\\n        [1400425949000, {'in': 5, 'out': 6}],\\n        [1400425950000, {'in': 7, 'out': 8}]\\n    ]\\n};\\n```\\n\\ncontains only one column `direction`, but that column has two more columns - `in` and `out` - nested under it. In the following examples, these nested columns will be referred to as **deep paths**.\\n\\nWhen specifying columns to the methods that set, retrieve and manipulate data, we use two argument types: `fieldSpec` and `fieldPath`. They are similar yet different enough to warrant this document.\\n\\n#### fieldPath\\n\\nA `fieldPath` refers to a **single** column in a series. Any method that takes a `fieldPath` as an argument only acts on one column at a time. The value passed to this argument can be either a string, an array or `null`.\\n\\n##### String variant\\n\\nWhen a string is passed, it can be one of the following formats:\\n\\n * simple path - the name of a single \\\"top level\\\" column. In the `DATA` example above, this would be either `value` or `status`.\\n * deep path - the path pointing to a single nested columns with each \\\"segment\\\" of the path delimited with a period. In the `DATA_FLOW` example above, the incoming data could be retrieved with `direction.in` as the `fieldPath`.\\n\\n##### List variant\\n\\nWhen a array is passed as a `fieldPath`, each element in the array is **a single segment of the path to a column**. So to compare with the string examples:\\n\\n * `['value']` would be equivalent to the string `value`.\\n * `['direction', 'in']` would be equivalent to the string `direction.in`.\\n\\nThis is particularly important to note because **this behavior is different** than passing a list to a `fieldSpec` arg.\\n\\n##### `None`\\n\\nIf no `fieldPath` is specified (defaulting to `null`), then the default column `value` will be used.\\n\\n#### fieldSpec\\n\\nA `fieldSpec` refers to **one or more** columns in a series. When a method takes a `fieldSpec`, it may act on multiple columns in a `TimeSeries`. The value passed to this argument can be either a string, an array or `null`.\\n\\n##### String variant\\n\\nThe string variant is essentially identical to the `fieldPath` string variant - it is a path to a single column of one of the following formats:\\n\\n * simple path - the name of a single \\\"top level\\\" column. In the `DATA` example above, this would be either `value` or `status`.\\n * deep path - the path pointing to a single nested columns with each \\\"segment\\\" of the path delimited with a period. In the `DATA_FLOW` example above, the incoming data could be retrieved with `direction.in` as the `fieldSpec`.\\n\\n##### List variant\\n\\nPassing a array to `fieldSpec` is different than the aforementioned behavior in that it is explicitly referring to **one or more columns**. Rather than each element being segments of a path, **each element is a full path to a single column**.\\n\\nUsing the previous examples:\\n\\n * `['in', 'out']` would act on both the `in` and `out` columns from the `DATA` example.\\n * `['direction.in', 'direction.out']` - here each element is a fully formed \\\"deep path\\\" to the two data columns in the `DATA_FLOW` example.\\n\\nThe lists do not have to have more than one element: `['value'] == 'value'`.\\n\\nNOTE: accidentally passing this style of list to an arg that is actually a `fieldPath` will most likely result in an error. Passing something like `['in', 'out']` as a `fieldPath` will attempt to retrieve the nested column `in.out` which probably doesn't exist.\\n\\n##### `None`\\n\\nIf no `fieldSpec` is specified (defaulting to `null`), then the default column `value` will be used.\\n\\n#### fieldSpecList\\n\\nThis is a less common variant of the `fieldSpec`. It is used in the case where the method is going to **specifically act on multiple columns**, such as `TimeSeries.collapse()`, where an array is expected. Therefore its usage is identical to the array variant of `fieldSpec`.\\n\\n---\\n### Index\\n\\nPond refers to certain standard time ranges, such as a particular hour, using an index. An index consists of two parts: a period such as \\\"this refers to a 6 hour period\\\", described with a string as \\\"6h\\\", and a position, which is a number that describes which 6 hour period in history we are referring to. An index such as \\\"6h-1234\\\" would be the 1234th 6hr period from the UNIX epoch (Jan 1st, 1970, UTC time). This string is typically referred to as an \\\"Index String\\\". This is distinct from an Index, which is an object wrapping of this string to allow easier handling of the index.\\n\\n---\\n### Missing values\\n\\nIn pond, a missing value is a `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`. That is distinct from a point on a TimeSeries that doesn't exist at all. You can use `fill()` to fill in missing values, while you might use `align()` to add new points where points where expected but non-existent.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are aggregating over a `Collection` or `TimeSeries`, you can supply filter functions that will treat missing values in a variety of ways.\\n\\n---\\n### Pipeline\\n\\nThis is Pond's main processing mechanism. It is an event based system that can process either streaming events, or batch process bounded collections of events such as a TimeSeries.\\n\\n---\\n### Processor\\n\\nA node generated internally in a Pipeline. These nodes take events in and produce events out. You don't work with Processors directly. Instead you use the chainable methods on the Pipeline.\\n\\n---\\n### Roll-ups\\n\\nWe use the term roll-up when building summary TimeSeries. An example would be turning 30 second measurement data into a TimeSeries of 5 minute average summaries.\\n\\nYou can perform common roll-ups directly on a TimeSeries, or as part of a Pipeline.\\n\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./src/website/guides/glossary.md\n ** module id = 175\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"\\n# Pond.js\\n\\n---\\n\\nPond.js is a library built on top of [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to provide time-based data structures, serialization and processing within our tools.\\n\\nFor data structures it unifies the use of time ranges, events and collections and time series. For processing it provides a chained pipeline interface to aggregate, collect and process batches or streams of events.\\n\\nWe are still developing Pond.js as it integrates further into our code, so it may change or be incomplete in parts. That said, it has a growing collection of tests and we will strive not to break those without careful consideration.\\n\\n## Rational\\n\\n[ESnet](http://www.es.net) runs a large research network for the US Department of Energy. Our tools consume events and time series data throughout our network visualization applications and data processing chains. As our tool set grew, so did our need to build a Javascript library to work with this type of data that was consistent and dependable. The alternative for us has been to pass ad-hoc data structures between the server and the client, making all elements of the system much more complicated. Not only do we need to deal with different formats at all layers of the system, we also repeat our processing code over and over. Pond.js was built to address these pain points.\\n\\nThe result might be as simple as comparing two time ranges:\\n\\n```js\\nconst timerange = timerange1.intersection(timerange2);\\ntimerange.asRelativeString();  // \\\"a few seconds ago to a month ago\\\"\\n```\\n\\nOr simply getting the average value in a timeseries:\\n\\n```js\\ntimeseries.avg(\\\"sensor\\\");\\n```\\n\\nOr quickly performing aggregations on a timeseries:\\n\\n```js\\nconst timeseries = new TimeSeries(weatherData);\\nconst dailyAvg = timeseries.fixedWindowRollup(\\\"1d\\\", {value: avg});\\n```\\n\\nOr much higher level batch or stream processing using the Pipeline API:\\n\\n```js\\nconst p = Pipeline()\\n    .from(timeseries)\\n    .take(10)\\n    .groupBy(e => e.value() > 65 ? \\\"high\\\" : \\\"low\\\")\\n    .emitOn(\\\"flush\\\")\\n    .to(CollectionOut, (collection, windowKey, groupByKey) => {\\n        result[groupByKey] = collection;\\n    }, true);\\n```\\n\\n## What does it do?\\n\\nPond has three main goals:\\n\\n 1. **Data Structures** - Provide a robust set of time-related data structures, built on Immutable.js\\n 2. **Serialization** - Provide serialization of these structures for transmission across the wire as Avro buffers or strings, including to our Python version of this library\\n 3. **Processing** - Provide processing operations to work with those structures\\n\\nHere is a summary of what is provided:\\n\\n* **TimeRange** - a begin and end time, packaged together\\n* **Index** - A time range denoted by a string, for example \\\"5m-1234\\\" is a specific 5 minute time range, or \\\"2014-09\\\" is September 2014\\n* **TimeEvent** - A timestamp and a data object packaged together\\n* **IndexedEvents** - An Index and a data object packaged together. e.g. 1hr max value\\n* **TimeRangeEvents** - A TimeRange and a data object packaged together. e.g. outage event occurred from 9:10am until 10:15am\\n\\nAnd forming together collections of events:\\n\\n* **Collection** - A bag of events, with a helpful set of methods for operating on those events\\n* **TimeSeries** - An ordered Collection of Events and associated meta data, along with operations to roll-up, aggregate, break apart and recombine TimeSeries.\\n\\nAnd then high level processing via pipelines:\\n\\n* **Pipeline** - Stream or batch style processing of events to build more complex processing operations, either on fixed TimeSeries or incoming realtime data.

Pond.js contains several methods to adjust or sanitize a series of less than optimal data. As with all other mutation operations in pond.js, these methods will return new `Event` objects, new `Collections` and new `TimeSeries` as apropos.\\n\\n### Filling\\n\\nData might contain missing or otherwise invalid values. `TimeSeries.fill()` can perform a variety of fill operations to smooth or make sure that the data can be processed in math operations without blowing up.\\n\\nIn pond.js, a value is considered \\\"invalid\\\" if it `undefined`, `null` or `NaN`. In PyPond `None`, a `NaN` value, or an empty string are considered missing.\\n\\n#### Usage\\n\\nThe `fill()` method on a TimeSeries takes a single `options` argument. Options are:\\n* `fieldSpec` - is the same as it is in the rest of the code - a string or list of strings denoting \\\"columns\\\" in the data. It can point `to.deep.values` using the usual dot notation.\\n* `method` - denotes the fill or interpolation method to use. Valid values are **zero**, **pad** and **linear**.\\n* `limit` - a limit on the number of events that will be filled and returned in the new `TimeSeries`. The default is to fill all the events with no limit.\\n\\nA complete sample usage could look like this:\\n\\n```\\n    const ts = new TimeSeries(data);\\n\\n    const filled = ts.fill({\\n        fieldSpec: ['direction.in', 'direction.out'],\\n        method: \\\"linear\\\",\\n        limit=6\\n    });\\n```\\n\\n##### The method option\\n\\nThere are three fill methods:\\n\\n* `zero` - the default - will transform any invalid value to a zero.\\n* `pad` - replaces an invalid value with the the previous good value: `[1, null, null, 3]` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 3]`.\\n* `linear` - interpolate the gaps based on the surrounding good values: `[1, null, null, null, 3]` becomes `[1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]`.\\n\\nNote: neither `pad` or `linear` can fill the first value in a series if it is invalid, and they can't start filling until good value has been seen: `[null, null, null, 1, 2, 3]` would remain unchanged. Similarly, `linear` can not fill the last value in a series.\\n\\n##### The `limit` option\\n\\nThe optional `limit` controls how many values will be filled before it gives up and starts returning the invalid data until a valid value is seen again.\\n\\nThere might be a situation where it makes sense to fill in a couple of missing values, but no sense to pad out long spans of missing data. This options sets the limit of the number of missing values that will be filled - or in the case of `linear` *attempt* to be filled - before it just starts returning invalid data until the next valid value is seen.\\n\\nSo given `limit: 2` the following values will be filled in the following ways:\\n\\n```\\nOriginal:\\n    [1, null, null, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nZero:\\n    [1, 0, 0, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nPad:\\n    [1, 1, 1, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nLinear:\\n    [1, null, null, null, 5, 6, 7]\\n```\\n\\nUsing methods `zero` and `pad` the first two missing values are filled and the third is skipped. When using the `linear` method, nothing gets filled because a valid value has not been seen before the limit has been reached, so it just gives up and returns the missing data.\\n\\nWhen filling multiple columns, the count is maintained on a per-column basis.  So given the following data:\\n\\n```\\n    const data = {\\n        name: \\\"traffic\\\",\\n        columns: [\\\"time\\\", \\\"direction\\\"],\\n        points: [\\n            [1400425947000, {\\\"in\\\": 1, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425948000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425949000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425950000, {\\\"in\\\": 3, \\\"out\\\": 8}],\\n            [1400425960000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400425970000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": 12}],\\n            [1400425980000, {\\\"in\\\": null, \\\"out\\\": 13}],\\n            [1400425990000, {\\\"in\\\": 7, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400426000000, {\\\"in\\\": 8, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400426010000, {\\\"in\\\": 9, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n            [1400426020000, {\\\"in\\\": 10, \\\"out\\\": null}],\\n        ]\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThe `in` and `out` sub-columns will be counted and filled independently of each other.\\n\\nIf `limit` is not set, no limits will be placed on the fill and all values will be filled as apropos to the selected method.\\n\\n##### Constructing `linear` fill `Pipeline` chains\\n\\n`TimeSeries.fill()` will be the common entry point for the `Filler`, but a `Pipeline` can be constructed as well. Even though the default behavior of `TimeSeries.fill()` applies to all fill methods, the `linear` fill logic is somewhat different than the `zero` and `pad` methods. Note the following points when creating your own `method: 'linear'` processing chain.\\n\\n* When constructing a `Pipeline` to do a `linear` fill on multiple columns, chain them together like this rather than passing in a `field_spec` that is a list of columns:\\n```\\n    const pipeline = Pipeline()\\n        .fromSource(ts)\\n        .fill({fieldSpec: \\\"direction.in\\\", method: \\\"linear\\\"})\\n        .fill(fieldSpec: \\\"direction.out\\\", method: \\\"linear\\\"})\\n        .toKeyedCollections()\\n```\\n* If a non numeric value is encountered when doing a `linear` fill, a console.warn will be issued and that column will not be processed.\\n* When using an unbounded input (like `Stream`), it is a best practice to set a limit using the optional `limit`. This will ensure events will continue being emitted if the data hits a long run of missing values.\\n* When using an streaming source, make sure to shut it down \\\"cleanly\\\" using `.stop()`. This will ensure `.flush()` is called so any unfilled cached events are emitted.\\n\\n### Alignment of data\\n\\nThe align processor takes a `TimeSeries` of events that might come in with timestamps at uneven intervals and produces a new series of those points are aligned on precise time window boundaries.  A series containing four events with following timestamps:\\n\\n```\\n0:40\\n1:05\\n1:45\\n2:10\\n```\\n\\nGiven a period of `1m` (every one minute), a new series with two events at the following times will be produced:\\n\\n```\\n1:00\\n2:00\\n```\\n\\nOnly a series of `Event` objects can be aligned. `IndexedEvent` objects are basically already aligned and it makes no sense in the case of a `TimeRangeEvent`.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that the emitted/aligned event will only contain the fields that alignment was requested on. Which is to say if you have two columns, `in` and `out`, and only request to align the `in` column, the `out` value will not be contained in the emitted event.\\n\\n#### Usage\\n\\nThe full argument usage of the align method:\\n\\n```\\n    const ts = TimeSeries(data)\\n    const aligned = ts.align({\\n        fieldSpec: [\\\"in\\\", \\\"out\\\"],\\n        period: \\\"1m\\\",\\n        method: \\\"linear\\\",\\n        limit: 2\\n    });\\n```\\n\\n* `fieldSpec` - indicates which fields should be interpolated by the selected `method`. Typical usage of this option type. If not supplied, then the default field `value` will be used.\\n* `period` - an integer and the usual `s/m/h/d` notation like `1m`, `30s`, `6h`, etc. The emitted events will be emitted on the indicated boundaries. Due to the nature of the interpolation, one would want to use a window close to the frequency of the events. It would make little sense to set a window of `5h` on hourly data, etc.\\n* `method` - the interpolation method to be used: `linear` (the default) and `hold`.\\n* `limit` - sets a limit on the number of boundary interpolated events will be produced. If `limit: 2, period: '1m'` and two events come in at the following times:\\n\\n```\\n0:45\\n3:15\\n```\\n\\nThat would normally produce events on three alignment boundaries `1:00, 2:00 and 3:00` and that exceeds the `limit` so those events will have `null` as a value instead of an interpolated value.\\n\\n#### Interpolation methods\\n\\n##### Linear\\n\\nThis is the default method. It uses simple linear interpolation between values in `Event` objects to derive new values on to the alignment boundaries. Interpolation occurs between the last event before the boundary and the first point after. Interpolation can occur across multiple boundaries at once.\\n\\n##### Hold\\n\\nThis is a much simpler method. It just fills the selected field(s) with the corresponding value from the previous event.\\n\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./src/website/guides/missing.md\n ** module id = 177\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"## Processing pipelines\\n---\\n\\nIn this guide we dig into the processing capabilities of Pond.\\n\\nWhile Pond started life as a data structure library, as it grew up we discovered that we needed the ability to perform operations on the data structures we had built. We started with simple functions such as asking a TimeSeries for its average value for a given column. Then we added functions for splitting and composing TimeSeries back together. Then we wanted to do more complicated things like filtering, fill missing values, or aggregating events over time windows.\\n\\nAs a parallel requirement we were interested in providing a TimeSeries orientated approach to processing data on the cloud. Our first venture into this was with AWS Kinesis, which we wanted to process events in TimeSeries specific ways and then output new events as a result.\\n\\nFrom the need for better framework to build up our TimeSeries processing capabilities, combined with our need to process streams of events, grew a pipeline mechanism in Pond.\\n\\n### Pipelines\\n\\nThe Pipeline was developed as an event processing chain from the beginning. Events are passed in the top and new events are emitted at the bottom. All processing operations that a chain can produce are carried out this way.\\n\\nA pipeline is composed of three parts: an input, a chain of processors, and an output. Let's take those one at a time.\\n\\n#### Sources\\n\\nAn input source can be something like a TimeSeries itself, some other bounded source, such as a file, or a stream.\\n\\nIf the input is a stream, then that source will inject events into the processing chain. The built in `Stream` is a basic stream where the user can `addEvent()` to it manually and those events are forwarded into the processing chain. A more sophisticated streaming source might be collecting events off a PubSub subscription and injecting events into the processing chain automatically. Here's a simple example:\\n\\n```\\n    const stream = new Stream();\\n\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(stream)\\n        .to(CollectionOut, c => out = c);\\n\\n    stream.addEvent(evt1);\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\nIf the input is a bounded source, then events will be created by traversing the source from beginning to end, with each event in the source injected down the processing chain. This happens when an output is attached to the chain, not when the source is defined on the pipeline. As the output is attached a chain is constructed from the path of nodes leading back from the output to the source and events are batched though this chain until complete, with the result accumulated at the output.\\n\\nFinally, if the input is a TimeSeries, this is just a special case of a bounded source.\\n\\n```\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(timeseries)\\n        .select(\\\"in\\\")\\n        .to(CollectionOut, c => result = new TimeSeries({name: \\\"newTimeseries\\\", collection: c}));\\n```\\n\\n#### Processing chains\\n\\nPond contains a growing collection of processing nodes. These nodes are constructed using chained methods on the pipeline itself. You do not need to initialize the processing nodes themselves manually. However, it's worth understanding that behind the scenes you are constructing a chain of processing nodes.\\n\\nAll processing nodes take incoming events and output new events. Events may be Pond TimeEvents, TimeRangeEvents or IndexedEvents, depending on the type of processor. For instance if you calculate the `rate()` (change over time) between incoming events, the output will be a TimeRangeEvent because the rate value applies to a time range. Events can be converted within the chain using the Converter node (`pipeline.asTimeEvents()`, `pipeline.asTimeRangeEvents()` and `pipeline.asIndexedEvents()`).\\n\\nCurrent processors:\\n\\n * **aggregate** - take a collection of events (defined by a group, or all events) and aggregate them down to a single event\\n * **align** - interpolate events onto regular time boundaries (e.g. every 30 seconds)\\n * **collapse** - take event fields and reduce them down to a single field using some reducer function\\n * **fill** - fill in missing values in events (e.g. replace null values with linearly interpolated values from neighbor events)\\n * **filter** - remove events from the stream using a filter function\\n * **map** - remap an event's data to new data\\n * **select** - select out certain fields in events\\n * **take** - only allow a limited number of events to pass through the chain\\n \\nIn addition to defining the processing nodes via chained calls to the `pipeline` you can also set several types of state. For instance you can set a groupBy state (with `pipeline.groupBy()`) and this grouping will be held as state within the pipeline until a processing node needs to respect that. In this case an aggregation would respect that and output its result per grouping. States can be reset or changed further down the pipeline.\\n\\nTypes of state:\\n\\n * **groupBy** - define a way for future processors to group events together\\n * **windowBy** - define a window (e.g. every 5 minutes) to group events\\n * **emitOn** - define when events should be emitted from aggregations (e.g. on every event, or only when events move to the next window).\\n\\n#### Output\\n\\nThere are two general mechanisms for collecting the output of the processing chain. The first to be implemented was a callback style interface which let you provide a function that would be called with the result. Currently you can either output events or collections:\\n\\n```\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(stream)\\n        .to(EventOut, event => {/* do something with event */});\\n```\\n\\n```\\n    Pipeline()\\n        .from(stream)\\n        .to(CollectionOut, collection => {/* do something with collection */});\\n```\\n\\nIn some cases this is a very natural interface for an event processing chain like this one, and handles the case of the input being async or dealing with an ongoing stream perfectly. However, in many of our use cases, it was burdensome to place the users code into a callback when the pipeline was operating on a synchronous source anyway, such as a simple TimeSeries. So we added an alternative.\\n\\nIt is also possible to accumulate the result back on the pipeline itself and then return the result directly from the chain. To do this, use the outputs `Pipeline.toKeyedCollections()` and `Pipeline.toEventList()`. For example:\\n\\n```\\n    const collections = Pipeline()\\n        .from(timeseries)\\n        ...\\n        .toKeyedCollections();\\n```\\n\\nHere the result is returned from the Pipeline chain, rather than the Pipeline object itself. This therefore ends the chain.\\n\\nAlso note: that this will not work with an async source!\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./src/website/guides/processing.md\n ** module id = 178\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"## Rollup example\\n---\\nIn this example we have an simulated incoming stream of measurements, represented by the dots. The visualization you see shows the 5 min aggregations (both 50th and 90th percentile) of the incoming stream as a green bar chart. We calculate this as described below.\\n\\n### Events\\n\\nTo do this, each event is generated semi-randomly, but they could be coming from a real source. We add a new Event for each minute, but emit 5 per second to speed up the simulation. Essentially we do this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { TimeEvent } from \\\"pondjs\\\";\\n\\nconst value = getRandomValue();\\nconst time = getNextTime();\\nconst event = new TimeEvent(t, value);\\n```\\n\\nNow we want to do some things with that Event:\\n\\n * Store it, so we can show the scatter plot\\n * Aggregate it to give us our 5 min average and maximum values\\n\\nTo store it, we put it into a circle buffer that keeps the last n Events. Otherwise we'll eventually kill the browser. The circle buffer is placed in the React component's state.\\n\\n### Aggregation\\n\\nFor the more interesting part, the aggregation, we need to setup up a couple of Pond Pipelines to do the work. Here's the 5 min aggregator that we setup:\\n\\n```js\\n\\nimport { Stream, Pipeline, EventOut, percentile } from \\\"pondjs\\\";\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst stream = new Stream();\\n\\nPipeline()\\n    .from(stream)\\n    .windowBy(\\\"5m\\\")\\n    .emitOn(\\\"discard\\\")\\n    .aggregate({\\n        value: {value: percentile(90)}\\n    })\\n    .to(EventOut, event => {\\n        // store the output events in our component state\\n    });\\n```\\n\\nThe Pipeline now just needs a feed of events added to the `stream` in order to process them into a new aggregated events. Each time one of these new events is emitted we take that from the callback defined in `to()` and place it into the component's state.\\n\\n\\n```js\\nstream.addEvent(event);\\n```\\n\\n### Visualization with React\\n\\nThe first thing we need to do is turn our three event lists (the original events along with the two aggregated event streams) into `TimeSeries` objects which can then be passed to our charting code. Since we can construct `TimeSeries` object from a list of `Event`s, this is simply a matter of pulling the list from the circle buffer and giving it to the `TimeSeries` constructor.\\n\\nFor example, our 5 minute 50th percentiles:\\n\\n```js\\nconst name = \\\"5m-percentile-50\\\";\\nconst events = this.state.perc50Out.toArray(); // <- from circle buffer\\nconst avgSeries = new TimeSeries({name, events});\\n```\\n\\nNext we figure out the begin and end times for the chart. The chart expands outward until it gets to 3 hours and then pans with the new data. Once we calculate the beginTime and endTime we make a TimeRange to represent this range:\\n\\n```js\\nconst timeRange = new TimeRange(beginTime, endTime);\\n```\\n\\nFinally we `render()` the chart:\\n\\n```jsx\\n    render() {\\n        return (\\n            <ChartContainer timeRange={timeRange}>\\n                <ChartRow height=\\\"150\\\">\\n                    <YAxis\\n                        id=\\\"y\\\"\\n                        label=\\\"Value\\\"\\n                        min={0} max={1500}\\n                        type=\\\"linear\\\" />\\n                    <Charts>\\n                        <BarChart\\n                            axis=\\\"y\\\"\\n                            series={avgSeries}\\n                            columns={[\\\"value\\\"]} />\\n                        <BarChart\\n                            axis=\\\"y\\\"\\n                            series={maxSeries}\\n                            columns={[\\\"value\\\"]} />\\n                        <ScatterChart\\n                            axis=\\\"y\\\"\\n                            series={rawSeries} />\\n                    </Charts>\\n                </ChartRow>\\n            </ChartContainer>\\n        );\\n    }\\n```\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./src/website/guides/rollup.md\n ** module id = 179\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"## Getting started\\n\\n---\\n\\nPond will run in node.js or in the browser.

This was factored out\n// into this ASAP package. It was later adapted to RSVP which made further\n// amendments.
